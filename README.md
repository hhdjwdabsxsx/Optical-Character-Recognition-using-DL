## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using deep learning techniques. It includes the entire pipeline from data preparation to evaluation and post-processing.

## Sections Overview

### 1. Importing Libraries
All necessary libraries are imported to support data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

### 2. Helper Functions & Hyperparameters
This section defines all the helper functions used throughout the notebook and specifies the hyperparameters for model training.

### 3. Reading and Preparing the Dataset
The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and augmented to make it ready for training.

### 4. Modeling
The deep learning models for OCR are developed and trained in this section.

### 5. Evaluation & Comparison
Models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, and their performances are compared.

### 6. Post-processing
Additional steps to refine and enhance OCR output.

### 7. Conclusion
Summary and insights derived from the implementation.
